# Limitations and Future Work

## Current Limitations

- The lab environment is limited to a small number of virtual machines and does not represent a full-scale enterprise network
- Log sources are primarily endpoint-based and do not include network devices such as firewalls or routers
- Alerts were generated through simulated activity and not from live production traffic
- Incident response actions were limited to analysis and did not include automated remediation
- Correlation across multiple data sources was minimal due to the scope of the lab

## Future Improvements

- Add additional endpoints to simulate a larger SOC environment
- Integrate network-based log sources such as firewall or IDS logs
- Expand detection scenarios to include multiple attack techniques mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
- Implement alert correlation and case management workflows
- Explore automated response actions for high-severity alerts
- Improve dashboard customization and reporting

## Learning Roadmap

- Continue strengthening log analysis and SIEM skills
- Gain deeper understanding of detection engineering concepts
- Practice real-world incident investigation scenarios
- Enhance documentation and reporting aligned with SOC best practices
