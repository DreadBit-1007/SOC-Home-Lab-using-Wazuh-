# SOC-Home-Lab-using-Wazuh-
This project documents the design and implementation of a SOC-focused home lab using VMware, Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Wazuh. The lab simulates common attacker techniques in a controlled environment to study how such activities appear in system and network logs.

Wazuh is used to collect logs, generate alerts, and support investigation from a SOC analyst’s perspective. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in threat detection, log analysis, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping while following ethical and defensive security practices.
