# SOC-Home-Lab-using-Wazuh-Based Security Monitoring

This project documents the design and implementation of a SOC-focused home lab using VMware, Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Wazuh. The lab simulates common attacker techniques in a controlled environment to study how such activities appear in system and network logs.

Wazuh is used to collect logs, generate alerts, and support investigation from a SOC analyst’s perspective. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in threat detection, log analysis, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping while following ethical and defensive security practices.

## 👋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with fundamental Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows using a controlled virtual lab.  
The focus is on endpoint monitoring, alert detection, and analysis using a SIEM platform rather than attack execution.

The lab simulates real-world security events and analyzes how they are detected and triaged from a defender’s perspective.
