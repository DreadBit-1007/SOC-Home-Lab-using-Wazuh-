# Attack Simulation Overview

This section documents controlled security-related activities performed in the lab to generate logs and alerts for SOC analysis.

## Purpose
The goal of these simulations is not exploitation, but to understand:
- How common attacker techniques generate logs
- How those logs are collected by a SIEM
- How alerts are triggered and analyzed

## Scope
- All activities were performed in an isolated lab environment
- No real-world systems were involved
- Focus remains on detection and investigation

## SOC Perspective
Simulating attacker behavior helps SOC analysts:
- Identify early indicators of compromise
- Tune detection rules
- Improve incident response readiness
